## Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. Recovery depends on balance between inflammatory response and immune suppression, which can be CNS-protective but may worsen prognosis by increasing patients’ susceptibility to infections. Peripheral cholinergic blockade of immune reactions fine-tunes the immune response; therefore, we sought unknown RNA regulators of this blockade in post-ischemic stroke patients. Whole blood short RNA-sequencing from day 2 post-stroke patients (PREDICT cohort) compared to age-matched healthy controls revealed concomitant increases in transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) and decreases in microRNAs (miRs), and demonstrated a ‘change of guards’ between short RNA cholinergic regulators in patients’ circulation. Electrophoresis-based size-selection followed by RT-qPCR validated the top 6 upregulated tRFs in a separate cohort of stroke patients, and analysis of independent short RNA-sequencing datasets identified post-stroke enriched tRFs as originating from T- and B-lymphocytes, NK cells, and monocytes. Of these immune compartments, we found CD14+ monocytes to express the highest amounts of cholinergic transcripts. In-depth analysis of CD14+ regulatory circuits revealed distinct subsets of transcription factors carrying complementary motifs to miRs or tRFs, indicating distinct roles for the stroke-perturbed members of these small RNA species. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated murine RAW264.7 cells presented dexamethasone-suppressible upregulation of the top 6 tRFs identified in human patients, indicating an evolutionarily conserved tRF response to inflammatory cues. Our findings identify tRF/miR subgroups which may co-modulate the homeostatic response to stroke in patients’ blood and open novel venues for establishing RNA-targeted concepts for post-stroke diagnosis and therapeutics.
